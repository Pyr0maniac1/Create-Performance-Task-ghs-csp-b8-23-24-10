# AP COMPUTER SCIENCE PRINCIPLES - Student Handouts

## Effective Fall 2023

### Create Performance Task

Programming is a collaborative and creative process that brings ideas to life through the development of software. In the Create performance task, you will design and implement a program that might solve a problem, enable innovation, explore personal interests, or express creativity. Your submission must include the elements listed in the Submission Requirements section below.

You are allowed to collaborate with your partner(s) on the development of the program only. The video and Personalized Project Reference that you submit for this performance task must be completed individually, without any collaboration with your partner(s) or anyone else. You can develop the code segments used in your Personalized Project Reference with your partner(s) or on your own as you work on the performance task during class.

Please note that once your teacher has assigned this performance task as one of your AP score components, you are expected to complete the task without assistance from anyone except for your partner(s) and then only when developing the program code. You must follow the Guidelines for Completing the Create Performance Task section below.

#### General Requirements

You will be provided with a minimum of 9 hours of class time to complete and submit the following:

- Final program code (created independently or collaboratively)
- A video that displays the running of your program and demonstrates functionality you developed (created independently)
- Code Segments for your Personalized Project Reference (created independently)

Note: Students in nontraditional classroom environments should consult a school-based AP Coordinator for instructions.

### Submission Requirements

#### COMPONENT A: PROGRAM CODE (CREATED INDEPENDENTLY OR COLLABORATIVELY)

Submit one PDF file that contains all of your program code (including comments). Include comments or acknowledgments for any part of the submitted program code that has been written by someone other than you and/or your collaborative partner(s).



### Guidelines for Completing the Performance Task

#### Academic Integrity and Plagiarism Policy

This policy addresses plagiarism and academic integrity in completing the Create Performance Task.



### Preparing for the Performance Task

Prior to beginning the performance task, you should:



### Completing the Performance Task

You must:
### COMPONENT B: VIDEO (CREATED INDEPENDENTLY)

Submit one video file that demonstrates the running of your program as described below. Collaboration is not allowed during the development of your video.

Your video must demonstrate your program running, including:

- Input to your program
- At least one aspect of the functionality of your program
- Output produced by your program

Your video may NOT contain:

- Any distinguishing information about yourself
- Voice narration (though text captions are encouraged)

Your video must be:

- Either .webm, .mp4, .wmv, .avi, or .mov format
- No more than 1 minute in length
- No more than 30MB in file size

### COMPONENT C: PERSONALIZED PROJECT REFERENCE (CREATED INDEPENDENTLY)

To assist in responding to the written response prompts on exam day, submit required portions of your code by capturing and pasting program code segments you developed during the administration of this task.

Procedure: Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a student-developed procedure that implements an algorithm used in your program and a call to that procedure.

#### List: 

Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a list (or other collection type) being used to manage complexity in your program.

1. The first program code segment must show how data have been stored in the list.
2. The second program code segment must show the data in the same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing data or accessing multiple elements in the list, as part of fulfilling the program's purpose.

### Guidelines for Completing the Performance Task

#### Academic Integrity and Plagiarism Policy

- Plagiarism: The use of program code, media (e.g., video, images, sound), data, information, or evidence created by someone else or with generative AI tools in the creation of a program and/or a program code segment(s), without appropriate acknowledgment (i.e., through citation, through attribution, and/or by reference), is considered plagiarism.
- Acceptable Generative AI Use: Students are permitted to utilize generative AI tools as supplementary resources for understanding coding principles, assisting in code development, and debugging.

### Preparing for the Performance Task

Before starting the task, you should:

- Obtain content knowledge and skills related to the task.
- Review the performance task directions and guidelines.
- Brainstorm problems or interests that programming can address or develop.
- Be prepared to collaborate with peers as necessary and practice various aspects of the performance task.

### Completing the Performance Task

You must:

- Submit all three components of your performance task as final before the deadline.
- Follow a calendar or schedule for completing all task components.
- Apply the computer science knowledge you've gained throughout the course.
- Use acceptable acknowledgment practices when using external resources to avoid plagiarism.
